    "definition": "An API (application Programming Interface) is a set of methods, properties, events, and URLs that developers use to interact with components of a user's web browser. Web APIs are built into the web browser and contain methods that allow us to manipulate a webpage using JavaScript.",
    "background": "A web browser, or browser, is a program used to access information on the World Wide Web. Browsers access information on the web. Every web page is effectively a series of files sitting on a server somewhere. Browsers use the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) to retrieve resources from a web server and display them on a user's device. The client (user/browser) has an IP address associated with it. For example, when you log into Netflix for example from your browser, the browser (on your behalf) sends a request to Netflix's server to access its site. The server then responds and serves up the files necessary (HTML, CSS, JS, etc) to access the site, thus fulfilling the request.",
    "notesByTopic": {
        "DOM": "DOM stands for the Document Object Model. When we open a webpage, the browser creates a tree of objects that represent the opened page. That tree of objects is the DOM.",
        "this": "The window object represents the browser window. The window object contains the document as a property. Console logging window.document returns the html DOM for the webpage. You can also log the body of the html document by console logging document.body. -- 51:41 -- skipped folder 3"
